Logistic Regression for Classifying Diabetic Patients by Food Type

This project demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression to classify diabetic patients based on the type of food they consume. The notebook walks through the process of building a predictive model to understand the relationship between various features and how they influence food consumption patterns among diabetic patients.

Overview
The purpose of this project is to classify diabetic patients by the type of food they consume using Logistic Regression. The goal is to understand the relationship between certain features (e.g., patient characteristics) and their food preferences, which can help guide better dietary recommendations for diabetic patients.

Data
The dataset used in this notebook includes information about diabetic patients and the types of food they consume. Specific features of the data include:

Patient characteristics (age, gender, etc.)
Blood sugar levels and other clinical measurements
Food types categorized into various groups (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, etc.)
The data is processed and prepared for classification tasks using Logistic Regression.

Requirements
To run the notebook, the following Python packages are required:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
statsmodels
You can install all dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
Setup Instructions
To run the project locally:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sheriff18/classification.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd LogisticRegression
Open the Jupyter Notebook (DiabeticPatientsFoodType.ipynb) to run the Logistic Regression model:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook DiabeticPatientsFoodType.ipynb
Project Structure
LogisticRegression/DiabeticPatientsFoodType.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the Logistic Regression analysis.
Data: The dataset used in the notebook (not included in the repository, add your data as needed).
Models: Trained models saved for future use.
Methodology
The project follows these steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing, such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and explore the data to understand its structure and key relationships.

Logistic Regression Model: Apply Logistic Regression to classify patients based on the type of food they consume.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

Conclusion
This notebook demonstrates how Logistic Regression can be effectively applied to classify diabetic patients by their food consumption patterns. The model provides insights into the factors that influence food choices and can be extended to provide personalized dietary recommendations for diabetic patients.
