# Classification-in-Machine-Learning

# Introduction
Classification is a critical part of supervised machine learning, where the goal is to categorize data into predefined classes. This project includes several popular machine learning classifiers implemented using Python and tested on well-known datasets such as the Iris dataset, MNIST dataset, and more.

The project explains how classification models are built from scratch, how to fine-tune hyperparameters, and how to interpret results. In addition, feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance model performance.

# Classification Algorithms
This project covers a variety of classification algorithms, including but not limited to:

Logistic Regression: A simple and widely used classification algorithm suitable for binary classification problems.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A lazy learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful classifier that works well with high-dimensional data.
Decision Trees: A tree-like structure for decision-making, commonly used for classification tasks.
Random Forests: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve performance and accuracy.
Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
Neural Networks: A more complex model using artificial neurons to solve classification problems.
Gradient Boosting Algorithms: Like XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM, these models are commonly used for structured data.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in building a machine learning model. In this project, several preprocessing techniques are applied:

Handling missing values: Techniques like mean/median imputation or removing null entries.
Categorical encoding: Transforming categorical features using methods like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scaling features: Standardization or normalization is used to bring all features to the same scale, which is particularly important for algorithms like SVM or k-NN.
Train-test split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

# Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays an essential role in improving the performance of machine learning algorithms. In this project, feature engineering techniques such as:

Feature extraction: Deriving new features from existing ones, such as interaction terms or polynomial features.
Dimensionality reduction: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) are used to reduce the number of features, making the model more efficient.

# Model Training
The classification models are trained using well-known datasets to evaluate their performance and accuracy. The training process involves:

Hyperparameter tuning: Using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomSearchCV to find the optimal parameters.
Cross-validation: Applying k-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization performance of models.
Regularization: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization are used to prevent overfitting in models such as Logistic Regression and SVM.

# Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is critical in machine learning to determine how well a model performs on unseen data. The following evaluation techniques are applied:

Confusion Matrix: To visualize the performance of a classification model and its errors.
Classification Report: This report includes precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
ROC Curve and AUC: These plots help to analyze the true positive rate and false positive rate for binary classification.

# Performance Metrics
In this project, we use several performance metrics to evaluate the classifiers:

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives.
F1-Score: A weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC): The area under the ROC curve that helps to evaluate model performance, particularly in binary classification.
